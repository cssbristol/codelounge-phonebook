This project is a simple C implementation of a rudimentary phonebook.

This project aims to help you use structs whilst programming and understanding I/O operations in C.

You will be able to add contacts to your phonebook with given numbers and then search for the numbers given the contact name.
The next section will give you an overview of how to write/read from files on your computer.

If you finish all of that and still want to carry on we'll have a few optional extras.

We've given you a skeleton project with very few things filled in apart from some essentials and stuff you haven't seen before.

This project isn't too far beyond the scope of your abilities so it'll be fairly hands off from here on out.

To start I would recommend implementing the phonebook and contact structures you will be using for the rest of the project.


maybe do some cool rsa crypto crap and teach them about it so they feel like they've learnt something new and some interesting bollocks
about how C does file and standard I/O.

Some useful functions:

some quick explanations

strncpy():
fgets():
sscanf():
malloc explanation
